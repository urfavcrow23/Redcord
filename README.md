  <i> The project aims to redesign the popular online platform Reddit in the theme of Discord. Reddit is a social news aggregation and discussion website where registered members can submit content, such as text posts or direct links. On the other hand, Discord is a communication platform primarily designed for creating communities. This project seeks to merge the functionalities and aesthetics of both platforms to create a unique and engaging user experience.
